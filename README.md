# AntiEnderChest
Enderchest limitation plug-ins that are supposed to be used on CPvP servers.

It is very simple and can prevent enderchests from being opened.

The config allows you to decide whether or not to restrict privileges as well.

# Permissions
`aec.bypass` - `People who can circumvent restrictions`

# Config
`bypass_perm` - `If you want to make it unavailable even to op-holders or authority holders, set this value to false.`
